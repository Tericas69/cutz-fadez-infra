    <div class="blog-title">BEGINNER GOLF MISTAKES YOU CAN FIX TODAY</div>
 
    <p>Golf is one of the most rewarding sports out there, but nothing exposes your habits like that first swing on the tee box. Whether you're brand new or still learning the basics, most golfers start with the same handful of mistakes. The good news: these are easy to fix.</p>
 
    <div class="blog-section-title">1. Gripping the Club Too Tight</div>
<p>New golfers tend to choke the club like it owes them money. A tight grip kills your swing, reduces rotation, and adds tension that ruins consistency. Try holding the club like a firm handshake — solid but relaxed.</p>
 
    <div class="blog-section-title">2. Trying to Swing Too Hard</div>
<p>Power in golf doesn't come from muscling the ball. It comes from tempo, rotation, and staying balanced. Slow things down and focus on clean contact. Distance will come naturally.</p>
 
    <div class="blog-section-title">3. Not Aiming Properly</div>
<p>Many beginners aim their body instead of the clubface. Remember, the clubface decides where the ball starts. Take a moment to square the club, then align your feet and shoulders.</p>
 
    <div class="blog-section-title">4. Neglecting the Short Game</div>
<p>Everybody loves to hit drivers. But strokes are lost inside 50 yards. Spend time practicing chips and putts. You'll drop your scores faster than any other way.</p>
 
    <div class="blog-section-title">5. Wearing Uncomfortable or Heavy Apparel</div>
<p>Golf requires movement, rotation, and flexibility. Heavy shirts or uncomfortable fabrics hold you back. Look for lightweight, moisture-wicking polos — which is exactly why Cutz & Fadez apparel exists.</p>
